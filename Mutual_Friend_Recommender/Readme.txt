To run the application you need to consider the following steps,

1)First delete the following folders which might have been generated from the previous run,
job_output* (* can be 1,2,3 so on)
Mutual_Freind_Stage*
Dont delete the output folder as it is where the final ouput will be present.

2)Pass the following arguments before running the program,
Input/Sample.txt 1 66 -90

ie Path for the input file which contains the checkins data, the userid you want to suggest the friends to, the current latitude and longitude of the user 

3) To view the ouput, open the output folder and view the mutual friends, which shows the pair userid and no of mutual friends the user have with the user id provided in the input.
